Student life is definitely not easy, and having to study
literally all the time for exam or the other can be super
frustrating. But as they say, there is a method to every
madness - Let's talk about the method. Exam season is here
and we know you need some study advice to keep your head in
the game.
</p>
<p>
<strong>1. (Don't) stop cramming 🙇‍♂️</strong>
</p>
<p>
Cramming is the worst way to understand anything, especially
when you try to cram all your syllabus in one night. The
trick is to read the same chapter, same syllabus every week
- such that your brain naturally remembers what you read.
Remember when Jeetu Bhaiya said - "21 din mein koi bhi aadat
ban jaati hai", yes exactly that!

<strong>
  2. Make sure you have a set time to study ⏳
</strong>
</p>
<p>
You know when we were young and moms used to say - 'Roz bas
ek ghanta padh le!' Well that's true my friend. Studying
just 1 hours everyday, on a set time will save you from
those all nighters right before exam. Don't just try to be
consistent with your study, study at the same hour everyday.

<strong>
  3. Understand and try to love what you study 💖📚
</strong>
</p>
<p>
While it's true that a formula or an equation will not
really help you in life 10 years later, it's still knowledge
that makes us more curious, and open to learning. Learning
new concepts of any new subject is super fun and
interesting! If you really try to love what you're studying,
you are surely going to ace it!

<strong>4. Don't study without a goal 🥅</strong>
</p>
<p>
Why do your textbooks have separate chapters and questions
after each on of them? It's because each chapter addresses a
different part of the subject and needs to be studied
separately. Always study one chapter at a time, and finish
the entire chapter fully before moving on to the next one.

<strong>
  5. Start with the difficult subjects or topics 🙆‍♂️
</strong>
</p>
<p>
How many times have you started a study session and asked
yourself - "Shuru kaha se karu?" We have a simple solution
to this huge problem - start with the most difficult. It
will take the most time and will give the most confidence
when you successfully complete it.

<p>
<strong>6. Don't study (too much) 🙅‍♀️</strong>
</p>
<p>
This is definitely the most important point. Studying the
entire syllabus in one hour is just as effective and not
studying at all. Space your studying time out over shorter
periods of time, with breaks in between.

<strong>7. Always study in a quite setting 🏡</strong>
</p>
<p>
Distraction is easy. Distraction will also mean
understanding less. Studying needs a flow. Remember that one
really good study session you had. How each word that you
read was so easy to understand, you could relate to each and
every question and understand most concepts. Now look at the
larger picture and see how quiet and peaceful that
environment was. That's what you need every time.
